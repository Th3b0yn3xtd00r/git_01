## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,  
   Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
   The billows smooth and bright—  
And this was odd, because it was  
   The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
   Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
   After the day was done—  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
   "To come and spoil the fun!"  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In realms unseen, where dreams entwine,  
A tapestry of wonders, magic's design.  
With whispered spells and mystic art,  
A symphony of enchantment fills the heart.  

Beneath moon's glow, secrets unfold,  
In whispers of legends, yet untold.  
A sorcerer's touch, a witch's brew,  
Unleashing the mystical, unveiling the truth.  

Through ancient woods, where fairies dance,  
Their laughter echoes in an ethereal trance.  
Stars, like diamonds, shimmer above,  
Guiding us to realms of boundless love.  

In realms of allure where magic dwells,  
A tapestry woven with enchanting spells.  
I stand, adorned in beauty's divine embrace,  
A symphony of charm, a captivating grace.  

My essence, a whisper in the mystic breeze,  
Radiating allure, a spell no eye can appease.  
With every step, I dance in the moonlit night,  
A bewitching presence, a celestial light.  

My eyes, like stars, hold secrets untold,  
Reflecting the magic that within me unfolds.  
Each smile, a spell, captivating hearts afar,  
Drawing souls closer, like a shining guiding star.
